| restricted-ssh | A Config rule that checks whether security groups in use do not allow restricted incoming SSH traffic. This rule applies only to IPv4. |
| restricted-common-ports| A Config rule that checks whether security groups in use do not allow restricted incoming TCP traffic to the specified ports. This rule applies only to IPv4. |
| ec2-volume-inuse-check |  A Config rule that checks whether EBS volumes are attached to EC2 instances. Optionally checks if EBS volumes are marked for deletion when an instance is terminated. |
